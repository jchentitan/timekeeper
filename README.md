Timesheet is under construction up to this initial commit

What's done:
1. TimesheetController accessible at  /Timesheet/Weekly?id=1
2. Trying to figure out a way for TimesheetController action "SaveData"; User experience is upon landing at localhost:####/Timesheet/Weekly?id=1 Click on ~Save to store user input into the database.  Now, there are projects/tasks that vary depending on user "id". 
3. The View of the timesheet controller is created with jQuery.  User experience is filling in each form input or in this case number of hours per week and per user.  See project TimesheetClientSide.
